## Preparation Steps for the scRNA-Seq Data Analysis Workshop

1. **Install R and RStudio:**
   - **R:** Download and install the latest version of R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). Choose the mirror site nearest to you for a faster download.
   - **RStudio:** After installing R, download and install RStudio, which provides a more user-friendly interface for coding in R. Get it from [RStudio's official website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

2. **Install the Seurat package for scRNA-Seq data analysis:**
   - Open RStudio and install the Seurat package by running the following command in the console:
     ```R
     install.packages("remotes")
     remotes::install_github("satijalab/seurat", ref = "develop")
     ```
   - Load Seurat to make sure it was installed correctly:
     ```R
     library(Seurat)
     ```

3. **Read introductory materials:**
   - **Basic R Programming:**
     - Read "R for Data Sience", which is freely available [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) specially the first Chapter!
     - Read "An Introduction to R", which is freely available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html). Focus on the sections about data types, basic operations, and data frames.
   - **scRNA-Seq and Seurat:**
     - Read the Seurat vignettes on the [Satija Lab website](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started.html) to understand how to handle scRNA-Seq data using Seurat.

4. **Practical Exercises:**
   - Try out some basic R exercises to get comfortable with the syntax and basic data operations.
   - Work through the [Guided Clustering of scRNA-Seq Data](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html) tutorial available on the Seurat website to get practical experience with scRNA-Seq data analysis.

5. **Set up your working environment:**
   - Ensure that your computer meets the system requirements for handling large datasets, as scRNA-Seq analysis can be computationally intensive.
   - Organize a workspace in RStudio, creating specific projects or folders for your workshop materials for easy access during the workshop.
